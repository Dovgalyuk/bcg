# Basic Computer Games
Original programs of the book "BASIC Computer Games"

This is an unofficial mirror of the source code provided inside the book **"Basic Computer Games"**, aka **"101 BASIC Computer Games"**, by David H. Ahl, published in 1978.

The games are meant to run with Vintage BASIC, but if you are able to use them with other interpreters be my guest. Having Caps-Lock on is advisable, as the games were designed to work with capital letters.
